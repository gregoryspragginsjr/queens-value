But in order for us to truly deliver on our motto of “not to be served, but to serve,” we approached gen ed a little differently. Our general educational program functions so that you’ll get to be a part of three different learning communities, which are groups of classes that focus on examining one topic from various different lenses. This will allow you to connect with and develop a deep, real-world understanding of some society’s most complex issues.</p>
