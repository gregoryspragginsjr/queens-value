And the school spirit doesn’t end there. We have over 70 clubs and organizations to choose from, and if you can’t find one that sparks your interest—start your own!

But in order for us to truly deliver on our motto of “not to be served, but to serve,” we approached gen ed a little differently. Our general educational program functions so that you’ll get to be a part of three different learning communities, which are groups of classes that focus on examining one topic from various different lenses. This will allow you to connect with and develop a deep, real-world understanding of some society’s most complex issues.</p>
